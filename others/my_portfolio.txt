I'm Mirza Naeem Beg; a Computer Science & Engineering undergrad (3rd Year 1st Semester) at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST), Bangladesh, with a CGPA of 3.00+ out of 4.00. Currently, I am living in Dhaka, having spent much of my childhood in Mymensingh, where my love for technology flourished.

My journey into the tech realm began during my high school and college years in Mymensingh. Just as people make words out of letters to communicate successfully with each other through meaningful sentences, machines—or computers—establish communication similarly. This kind of analogy sparked my interest in computer science, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. After my admission to CSE, I discovered my aspiration to become an industry leading AI/ML expert. This ambition has driven me to explore various core branches of Computer Science, including Problem Solving, AI/ML, Web Development, Mobile App Development, Cybersecurity, Databases, and Computer Networks.

With a deep-rooted interest in technology since my college days, I am committed to learning and growing in this ever-evolving field. I firmly believe that one day, I will become a valuable asset to the tech industry, contributing innovative solutions and advancements to upcoming challenges.
